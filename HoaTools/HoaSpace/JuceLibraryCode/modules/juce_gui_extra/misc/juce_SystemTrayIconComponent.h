/**
    On Windows and Linux only, this component sits in the taskbar tray as a small icon.

    To use it, just create one of these components, but don't attempt to make it
    visible, add it to a parent, or put it on the desktop.

    You can then call setIconImage() to create an icon for it in the taskbar.

    To change the icon's tooltip, you can use setIconTooltip().

    To respond to mouse-events, you can override the normal mouseDown(),
    mouseUp(), mouseDoubleClick() and mouseMove() methods, and although the x, y
    position will not be valid, you can use this to respond to clicks. Traditionally
    you'd use a left-click to show your application's window, and a right-click
    to show a pop-up menu.
