/**
    A message that invokes a callback method when it gets delivered.

    You can use this class to fire off actions that you want to be performed later
    on the message thread.

    To use it, create a subclass of CallbackMessage which implements the messageCallback()
    method, then call post() to dispatch it. The event thread will then invoke your
    messageCallback() method later on, and will automatically delete the message object
    afterwards.

    Always create a new instance of a CallbackMessage on the heap, as it will be
    deleted automatically after the message has been delivered.

        You should implement this method and make it do whatever action you want
        to perform.

        Note that like all other messages, this object will be deleted immediately
        after this method has been invoked.
