HoaLibrary by Julien Colafrancesco, Pierre Guillot & Eliott Paris at CICM / Universite Paris 8 - 2012

The HoaLibrary (high order ambisonics library) is a two dimentional high order ambisonics processing set of externals for Max/Msp. It allows you to synthesize, transform and modulate sound fields. 
It has been elaborated to facilitate the use of the sphericals harmonics and the routing in the ambisonic domain for musicians and composers.  Thus, they should be able to let their creativity run free.

Windows Install :

Firt please delete the .mxo files in the package (\Max\Cycling '74\extensions and Max\Cycling '74\HoaLibrary\externals\OsX).
The easy solution is to put the "patches" folder and the "Cycling '74" folder include in the "max" folder of the package in the Max 5 or/and Max 6 folder application. Windows will ask you if you want to fusion the files and the folders, please accept for all. 
You can also copy just part of the package but we recommend to include all the files and to respect the paths.
The "HrtfDatabase" folder must be put in "C:/ProgramData/CicmLibrary/". If the "CicmLibrary" don't exist please create it.

OsX Install :


Firt please delete the .mxe files in the package (\Max\Cycling '74\extensions and Max\Cycling '74\HoaLibrary\externals\Windows).
The easy solution is to put the "patches" folder and the "Cycling '74" folder include in the "max" folder of the package in the Max 5 or/and Max 6 folder application. 
We recommend to include all the files and to respect the paths but you can also copy just part of the package.
The "HrtfDatabase" folder must be put in "/Library/Application Support/CicmLibrary/". If the "CicmLibrary" don't exist please create it.
