/**
    Creates an OpenGL context, which can be attached to a component.

    To render some OpenGL, you should create an instance of an OpenGLContext,
    and call attachTo() to make it use a component as its render target.

    To provide threaded rendering, you can supply an OpenGLRenderer object that
    will be used to render each frame.

    Before your target component or OpenGLRenderer is deleted, you MUST call
    detach() or delete the OpenGLContext to allow the background thread to
    stop and the native resources to be freed safely.
