    An AudioSource that takes a PositionableAudioSource and allows it to be
    played, stopped, started, etc.

    This can also be told use a buffer and background thread to read ahead, and
    if can correct for different sample-rates.

    You may want to use one of these along with an AudioSourcePlayer and AudioIODevice
    to control playback of an audio file.
