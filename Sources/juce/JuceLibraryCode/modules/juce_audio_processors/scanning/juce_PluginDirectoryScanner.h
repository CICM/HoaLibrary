                                        that crash during initialisation. If there are
                                        any plugins listed in it, then these will always
                                        be scanned after all other possible files have
                                        been tried - in this way, even if there's a few
                                        dodgy plugins in your path, then a couple of rescans
                                        will still manage to find all the proper plugins.

                                        application data directory (alongside your app's
                                        settings file) for this. The file format it uses
                                        is just a list of filenames of the modules that
                                        failed.
