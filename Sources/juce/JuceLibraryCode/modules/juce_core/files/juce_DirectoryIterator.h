/**
    Searches through a the files in a directory, returning each file that is found.

    A DirectoryIterator will search through a directory and its subdirectories using
    a wildcard filepattern match.

    If you may be finding a large number of files, this is better than
    using File::findChildFiles() because it doesn't block while it finds them
    all, and this is more memory-efficient.

    It can also guess how far it's got using a wildly inaccurate algorithm.
