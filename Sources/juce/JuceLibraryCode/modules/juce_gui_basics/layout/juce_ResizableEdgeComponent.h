/**
    A component that resizes its parent component when dragged.

    This component forms a bar along one edge of a component, allowing it to
    be dragged by that edges to resize it.

    To use it, just add it to your component, positioning it along the appropriate
    edge. Make sure you reposition the resizer component each time the parent's size
    changes, to keep it in the correct position.

        resize this component to keep it in place, as this won't happen automatically.

        limits on the size and position that the component can be stretched to. Make sure
