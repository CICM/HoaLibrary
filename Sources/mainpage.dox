Sound space is one of the first dimensions of the contemporary musical thought, specialy in the electroacoustic music domain but also in intermedia arts. In this context, the CICM has made of the spatialization its main research axis. This projects « La spatialisation du son par les musiciens pour les musiciens » and  « Des Interfaces pour la mise en espace du son » developed as a part of the LABEX Arts H2H aims to give spatialization models based on high order ambisonics to musicians and graphical interfaces to facilitate the manipulation of signal processing. It takes place between the MSH Paris-Nord and the plate-forme Arts-Sciences-Technologies. Partners are Louis-Lumière, GRAME, the Muse en Circuit, the University of Montréal and the ZKM. The IRCAM and the GMEA have also participated to the project.
