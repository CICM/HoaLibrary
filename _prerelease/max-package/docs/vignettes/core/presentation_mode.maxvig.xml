	Presentation Mode
	</header1>
		<bodytext>
			<i>Presentation mode</i> allows
			you to arrange and resize user interface objects in your patch independently of their functional position and size in <i>patching mode</i> (where you connect objects together). Because you cannot "patch" in presentation mode, it is possible to provide an editing experience closer to a typical object-oriented drawing application.
		</bodytext>
		<ul>
		<li>
			You can toggle back and forth between patching and presentation modes as youâ€™re working. In both modes, you can lock and unlock the patcher
			window to switch between editing and running the patch.
		</li>
		<li>
			Max also supports
			<link type="vignette" module="core" name="patcher_views">multiple views of a patcher</link>. You can use this feature to leave one view in patching mode while keeping a second view in presentation mode. Whenever you select an object in one view, it will be highlighted in the other view.
		</li>
		<li>
			By enabling the Open in Presentation attribute in the
			<link type="vignette" module="core" name="patcher_inspector">patcher inspector</link>,
			you can set a patch so that it opens in presentation mode.
		</li>
		</ul>
