			Max lets you use and create prototypes—user interface object that are saved with a
			commonly used combination of settings that you would otherwise set one at a time in
			the object’s Inspector (this is particularly useful with those user interface objects
			that have a large number of settings). You can retrieve a pre-existing prototypes
			with a few clicks rather than laboriously copying, cutting and pasting from your old patchers.
		</bodytext>
	<bodytext>
			You can also create handsome prototypes in your own UI design “style” and have them
			on hand for quick user interface prototyping
	</bodytext>
	<bodytext>
			You can use the
			<link anchor="circular_prototypes" module="core" name="circular_object_menu" type="vignette">Circular object menu</link>			
			to view your current prototypes and apply their styles to a selected object.
