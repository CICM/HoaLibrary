	Freezing Max for Live Devices
</header1>
	<bodytext>
		<i>Freezing</i> a Max device prepares it for distribution. A frozen device 
		contains files it needs to operate. These files might include subpatchers, 
		audio files, image files, Javascript code, or third-party Max external objects. 
		(When you freeze a device that contains third-party external objects, you can include
		both Windows and Macintosh versions of the external in your Max search path, if you have
		them both. The frozen device device will then will contain both versions, and will work 
		on both platforms.) Max analyzes your device to find any files it uses (called 
		<link type="vignette" module="core" name="live_dependencies">dependencies</link>), 
		and then combines these files with your device. When a frozen device is opened, 
		the files inside the device are used, even if similarly named files reside on 
		your disk in the Max 
		<link type="vignette" module="core" name="search_path">search path</link>.

	Note that the device is not frozen immediately when you click the freeze button. It is frozen when you save it. Before saving, you can make further changes to the device after clicking the Freeze button by clicking the Freeze button again to unfreeze. When your changes are finished, click the Freeze button again, then choose <b>Save</b> from the File menu.
