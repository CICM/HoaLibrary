	Specifying Colors Using RGB and RGBA Formats
	</header1>
		<bodytext>
			Prior to Max version 5, colors were specified as three integer numbers from 0-255 for the R, G, and B components. 
			We call this the legacy or RGB color format. The preferred way to specify a color is with four 
			floating-point numbers between 0 and 1. The first three numbers are for the R, G, and B components, and the fourth 
			value is for alpha. We call this format RGBA. Alpha defines the transparency of the color. If the alpha is 0, you 
			won't see the color at all. If the alpha is 1, the color is completely opaque. When converting between a legacy 
			color style, the alpha is set to 1.

			For compatibility with old patches, you can continue to send messages to objects to specify 
			color in the legacy RGB format. However, in most cases, a new message has been defined for 
			the RGBA format. For example, the <o>comment</o> object accepts a message <m>frgb</m> to set 
			the text color using three integers (RGB format). It also accepts a new <m>textcolor</m> 
			message to set the text color using four floats (RGBA format). In the Max Reference manual, 
			RGB format messages are identified as Legacy RGB Format with a link to this page.
