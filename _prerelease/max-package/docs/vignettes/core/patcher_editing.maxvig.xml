<bodytext>
	Selecting and editing text objects in a patcher should be a familiar process. There are a few 
	<link type="vignette" module="core" name="patching_preferences">preferences</link> for customizing 
	patcher editing, but below we describe the default behavior.

		<bodytext>
			Max uses the following rules for selecting text in an unlocked patcher:
		</bodytext>
		<ul>
		<li>
			A single click on a box select
			the entire box â€“ <i>the object itself</i>. This means that you can easily perform
			tasks such as copying objects or moving them.
		</li>
		<li>Double-clicking on a box will select the text for editing. So will clicking on a box that is already selected.</li>
		<li>
			Clicking and dragging around a box to select it does not select the
			text inside for editing.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can use the Enter key to enter and exit text editing mode for a text object. The Tab key will exit editing mode and deselect the box. The Enter key will select the entire box, so you can move it around, copy it, etc.. 
		</li>
	</ul>
