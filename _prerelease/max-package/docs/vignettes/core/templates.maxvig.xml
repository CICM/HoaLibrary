			You can create and use templates in Max. A template is a Max patcher document that includes a patch intended
			to get you started with certain types of applications you use often. Templates are generally larger and more
			complex than a
			<link type="vignette" module="core" name="clippings">clipping</link>,
			and they open in their own untitled Patcher Window of a preconfigured size
			rather than being pasted into an unlocked patcher window as a clipping is.
