	thinking two years from now.

	<ul>
		<li>
		The most commonly used documenting technique in Max is to add <o>comment</o> 
		objects to a patch.
	</li>
		<li><link module="core" name="annotations" type="vignette">Annotations</link> 
		appear in Patcher window's 
		<link module="core" name="status_bar" type="vignette">Status Bar</link> 
		when you move the mouse over an object in an unlocked patcher. They are 
		useful way to explain how your patch works.
	</li>
		<li><link module="core" name="hints" type="vignette">Hints</link> 
		(also known as tooltips) appear in the user interface of a locked patcher. 
		They help explain how to <i>use</i> your patch.
	</li>
		<li><link module="core" name="assistance_authoring" type="vignette">Assistance</link> 
		documents the purpose of inlets and outlets in subpatchers and abstractions.
