		The ProjectSearchPath Project is a very simple illustration of the power of the Project search path. When the main patcher opens, you should see the image shown below in Max. This is the <i>Project-local</i> copy of the file <i>chilis.jpg</i>.
		<img src="images/project-chilislocal.png"/>
		
		There happens to be a version of this file shipped with Max (located in the patches/media folder). In the Project window, right-click on the entry for <i>chilis.jpg</i> and select "Use Global Version".
		<img src="images/project-chooseglobal.png"/>
		When you now close and reopen the main patcher (from the Project window), you'll see that it now uses the <i>global</i> version of the file, as requested.
		<img src="images/project-chilisglobal.png"/>
		
		The Project-local version of <i>chilis.jpg</i> will only be found by this Project and is isolated from the rest of Max. This allows you to maintain Project-specific versions of patchers and media which won't interfere with your other patchers and Projects.
