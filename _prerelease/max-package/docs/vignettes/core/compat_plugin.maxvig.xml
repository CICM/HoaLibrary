		Plug-In Support in Max
	</header1>
		<bodytext>
			Max does not support building VST plug-ins from 
			patches. The objects used to build plug-ins are included in Max and 
			work - inside Max - as they did in the past.
		</bodytext>
		<bodytext>
			The <o>vst~</o> object is not compatible with VST plug-ins created 
			with earlier versions of Max. When used on PowerPC computers on the 
			Mac platform, the <o>vst~</o> object is not compatible with certain older third-party 
			VST plug-ins that do not support the VST 2.4 specification. By 
			contrast, VST plug-ins that work on the Mac Intel platform should 
			work better when hosted by <o>vst~</o> in Max than they did in 
			previous versions. 
		</bodytext>
		<bodytext>
			As an alternative to making plug-ins out of your patches, you may 
			wish to consider using the new features of the <o>poly~</o> object. 
			In addition to the <o>poly~</o> object's new multi-processor capabilities, 
			it can also load patchers dynamically without shutting off the audio 
			of the enclosing patch by using the new patchername attribute. The 
			<o>vst~</o> object's ability to load new plug-ins while the audio was 
			running was one of the primary reasons Max users converted patches 
			into VST plug-ins. With <o>poly~</o> in Max, this is no longer necessary.
