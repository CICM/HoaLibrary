	Object Inspectors and Settings Editors
	</header1>
	<bodytext>
	You'll see two types of inspector windows in Max.
</bodytext>
	<ul>
		<li>The <i>object Inspector</i> is used to edit the attributes of objects that live in patchers. It has colored rows and tabs.</li>
		<li><i>Settings editors</i> include the <link module="core" name="preferences_window" type="vignette">Preferences Window</link> and <link module="core" name="patcher_inspector" type="vignette">patcher inspector</link>. These windows have less colorful striped rows and gray tabs.</li>
	</ul>
	<bodytext>
	The two types of inspectors work similarly. You <link module="core" name="attributes_inspecting" type="vignette">edit settings and attributes</link> in the same way. But one important difference is that the object inspector window content updates to reflect the current selection of a patcher window. This allows you to leave the object inspector window open while working in a patcher. The content of a settings editor is not affected by a change in what is selected.
