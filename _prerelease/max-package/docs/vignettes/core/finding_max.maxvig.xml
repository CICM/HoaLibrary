		There are several ways to find an object that you might need for your Max patch. You
		can find a list of all Max objects in functional groups using the 
		<link module="core" name="max_functional" type="vignette">Max Objects by Function page</link>
		. If you want to just see all the Max objects in alphabetical order, you might prefer
		the <link module="core" name="max_alphabetical" type="vignette">Max Objects A-Z page</link>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The <link module="thesaurus" name="thesaurus" type="vignette">Max Object Thesaurus</link>
		helps you find objects (in Max, MSP and Jitter) based on some key words and phrases. This is
		a great place to find objects based on what you wish to accomplish.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		In addition, you can often find help on our website, in our user forum and in the
		<link module="max" name="maxindex" type="tutorial">Max Tutorials</link>.
