	<bodytext><i>Assistance</i> refers to the description of an object's

	menu, descriptive captions appear near an inlet or outlet 
	as you mouse over it.

	As you move the mouse over an object's inlets you'll notice that some are blue 
	and some are red. <i>Blue</i> inlets are known as "cold" inlets. They do 
	not produce any output (out the object's outlets) directly. <i>Red</i> inlets 
	are "hot" inlets and can produce output when you send a message into them.
