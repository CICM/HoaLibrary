			When you build a standalone application using Max you can use the ad_rewire driver in your standalone and it will
			create an ReWire Device that works independently of Max and other Max-created standalone applications.

	Using the ReWire driver with a standalone application
	</header2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			Launch your standalone application and choose Audio Status from the Options menu to show the Audio Status window. Choose ad_rewire
			from the driver pop-up menu. A default file called msprewire.config will be created in the <i>support/ad</i> folder for your standalone
			application’s package (Macintosh) or folder (Windows).
		</li>
		</ul>
	</bluebox>
	<br />
		<bodytext>
			The file <i>msprewire.config</i> contains two lines that specify the name that ReWire will use for the device and the number of audio channels.
			By default, the ReWire Device will take on the name of your application and will have 16 channels. You can edit this file to change the behavior
			of Max or your standalone. You can customize this by editing the <i>msprewire.config</i> file in the <i>support/ad</i> folder for your
			standalone. Note: This file doesn’t exist until the default one is created the first time you launch your standalone and choose ad_rewire in the
			Audio Status window.
