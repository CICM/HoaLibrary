Opening Patches
</header1>
<bodytext>
There are three ways to open a patch:
</bodytext>
<ul>
	<li>Double-click on the patch from within the <link type="vignette" module="core" name="file_browser">file_browser</link></li>
	<li>Choose Open... from the File menu</li>
	<li>Use the Finder or Windows Explorer to open the file</li>
</ul>
<br />
<bodytext>
	When you use another application to open a patcher file, it can't be guaranteed that the correct version of Max will be launched. Normally, you'll have both an editing version and a Runtime version of Max installed, and sometimes the Runtime version will be launched by mistake.
