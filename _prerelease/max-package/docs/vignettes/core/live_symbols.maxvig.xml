Using Symbols in Max for Live
</header1>
<bodytext>
	The "name space" in Max is global - when you have objects that have names associated with them such as 
	<o>coll</o>, <o>send</o>, <o>receive</o>, <o>table</o>, 
	or <o>buffer~</o> , you can share data between Max for Live devices. 
	In these cases, the Max name space is shared, but the 
	"signal processing space" is independent - each Max for Live device processes
	its audio or data separately.
</bodytext>
<bodytext>
	If you want a named object to be unique to a device, use three dashes (<b>---</b>) to 
	start the name of your
	<o>buffer~</o> or <o>send</o>/<o>receive</o> destination (e.g. <m>s ---filtercutoff</m>).
