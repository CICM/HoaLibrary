	Collective Build Scripts
	</header1>
<bodytext>
	You will probably build a collective or standalone application many times in the course of developing your project. A <i>build script</i> saves any modifications you make to the script in the collective editor, so you can avoid retyping it each time you build your collective.

Creating a collective build script
</header2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		When you have added the files you need for your collective, click the <b>Save Script...</b> button in the Collective editor
		window and type in a name for your script in the file dialog box. A copy of the current build instructions will be written to a text file.
	</li>
	</ul>
</bluebox>
	<br />
	<bodytext>
		If you have previously saved a build script for your collective, you can open the file and use it for quick editing and/or rebuilding.

Loading a collective build script
</header2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		Click the <b>Open Script...</b> button in the collective editor window and choose the build script you have created for your collective.
	</li>
	<li>
		The Collective editor window will display the contents of the file you have loaded. At this point, you can click the <b>Build</b> button to build your collective, or modify the script if necessary.
	</li>
	</ul>
</bluebox>
<br />
<bodytext>
	Note: Since a collective script uses absolute path names to refer to files, the script is not necessarily transferrable from one machine to another.
