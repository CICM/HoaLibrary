			The file browser shows you files that meet certain criteria you specify in a <i>query</i>. Unlike a traditional directory listing, the files are not normally organized by <i>where</i> they are on your hard drive, but by more useful properties such as file type, name, or date. The file browser is more like a search engine than the Finder or Windows Explorer.
