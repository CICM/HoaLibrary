This is a simple example of a mainpage you can create yourself. Place this inside of a file called {\ttfamily mainpage.\-dox} and use doxygen. If you specified {\ttfamily I\-N\-P\-U\-T} or {\ttfamily F\-I\-L\-E\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-T\-E\-R\-N\-S} in your Doxyfile please add {\ttfamily .dox} to your file patterns or {\ttfamily mainpage.\-dox} to your I\-N\-P\-U\-T files.
