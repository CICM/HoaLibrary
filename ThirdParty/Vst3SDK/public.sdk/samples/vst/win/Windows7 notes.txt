"VST 3 Examples" notes for compiling on Windows 7 / 8:

You need to alter the permissions for the folder 
C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
to allow yourself to have full control in the security pane of the properties dialog.
Otherwise Visual Studio won't be able to generate the VST 3 Plug-ins in that folder.
